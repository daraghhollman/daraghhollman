## About Me
My name is Daragh, I'm a student at University College Dublin studying Physics with Astronomy and Space Science. I love computational physics and programming, its exciting to be able to use mathematics and code to model the world around us!

I'm currently a research intern with the Planetary Magnetospheres research group at the Dublin Institue of Advanced Studies.

### Notable Projects
- Wallpaper creation based on data from JPL's Horizon API (horizons-wallpaper)
- An all in one tool for data visualisation of the Juno spacecraft, currently in orbit around Jupiter (JUPT)
