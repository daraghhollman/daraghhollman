## About Me
My name is Daragh, I'm a PhD student at Dunsink Observatory, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) - specifically working in the [Planetary Magnetospheres](https://github.com/DIASPlanetary) group. I study Mercury's magnetosphere and its interaction wtih the solar environment through the analysis of large data-sets from NASA's MESSENGER mission (2011-2015), and upon its arival, ESA/JAXA's BepiColombo. My work currently focuses on Mercury's magnetospheric boundaries - the bow shock and magnetopause and the automated detection of boundary crossings via simple machine learning methods. I'm a Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar, fully funded by Research Ireland.
