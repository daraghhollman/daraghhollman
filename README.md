## About Me
My name is Daragh, I'm a student at University College Dublin studying Physics with Astronomy and Space Science. I love computational physics and programming, its exciting to be able to use mathematics and code to model the world around us!

### Ongoing Projects
- Labwork at UCD (ucd_labs)
- Wallpaper creation based on data from JPL's Horizon API (OtherProjects/horizonWallpaper)
