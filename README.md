## About Me
My name is Daragh, I'm a recent graduate from University College Dublin with a first class honours in Physics with Astronomy and Space Science. I'm particularly interested in computing, and its applications to the field. In September, I'm starting a PhD at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies with their [Planetary Magnetospheres](https://github.com/DIASPlanetary) group.
